You are working on the existing “Agency Control Center” app you already created in Phase 1.

Do NOT rebuild from scratch. Reuse the current tech stack and structure:

- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- Auth: existing login system and middleware

======================================
PHASE 2 – VENDORS, EXPENSES, SALARIES
======================================

Goal of this phase:
- Track ALL money going out of the agency:
  - Vendor bills and payments
  - General operating expenses
  - Team salaries
- Provide a simple profit view: income (invoices) vs expenses.

Keep everything from Phase 1 working as-is.

------------------
1) PRISMA DATA MODEL
------------------

Extend schema.prisma with these models:

Vendor
- id
- name
- contactName
- email
- phone
- website
- address
- category (e.g. SOFTWARE, FREELANCER, MEDIA_BUY, OTHER)
- status (ACTIVE, INACTIVE)
- notes
- createdAt, updatedAt

ExpenseCategory
- id
- name        (e.g. “Software”, “Advertising”, “Office”, “Salaries”, “Travel”)
- code        (short code, unique, like “SOFT”, “ADV”)
- createdAt, updatedAt

Expense
- id
- vendorId (optional, null for generic expenses not tied to a vendor)
- categoryId
- description
- amount
- currency (default “INR”)
- expenseDate
- dueDate        (optional, if it’s a bill to be paid later)
- paidDate       (optional)
- status (PLANNED, DUE, PAID, CANCELLED)
- paymentMethod (BANK_TRANSFER, UPI, CASH, CARD, OTHER)
- reference      (invoice number, UTR, etc.)
- notes
- createdAt, updatedAt

TeamMember
- id
- name
- email
- roleTitle       (e.g. “SEO Specialist”, “Media Buyer”)
- status (ACTIVE, INACTIVE)
- baseSalary      (monthly amount)
- joinedDate
- exitDate        (optional)
- notes
- createdAt, updatedAt

SalaryPayment
- id
- teamMemberId
- month          (store as YYYY-MM, string)
- paymentDate
- amount
- currency (default “INR”)
- status (PAID, PENDING)
- paymentMethod (BANK_TRANSFER, UPI, CASH, OTHER)
- reference
- notes
- createdAt, updatedAt

Adjust existing models if needed:
- Optionally add a relation from ExpenseCategory to mark “isSalaryCategory” but that’s not mandatory.

Seed script updates:
- Create 3–4 ExpenseCategory records (Software, Advertising, Office, Salaries).
- Create 2–3 Vendors (e.g. Meta Ads, Google Ads, Freelance Designer).
- Create 2–3 TeamMembers with different roles and baseSalary.
- Insert some sample Expenses and SalaryPayments for the last 2–3 months.

Run migrations and update the Prisma client.

------------------
2) BACKEND API – NEW ROUTES
------------------

Add new Express routes under /api, all protected by existing auth middleware.

Vendors
- GET /api/vendors
  - Query params: status, search (by name/email)
- GET /api/vendors/:id
- POST /api/vendors
- PUT /api/vendors/:id
- PUT /api/vendors/:id/status   (toggle ACTIVE/INACTIVE)

Expense Categories
- GET /api/expense-categories
- POST /api/expense-categories
- PUT /api/expense-categories/:id

    - fromDate, toDate
    - vendorId
    - categoryId
    - status
  - Return list with related vendor and category
- GET /api/expenses/:id
- POST /api/expenses
  - Validate amount > 0 and expenseDate required.
- PUT /api/expenses/:id
- POST /api/expenses/:id/mark-paid
  - Body: paymentDate, paymentMethod, reference
  - Sets status=PAID and paidDate=paymentDate.

Team Members
- GET /api/team-members
  - Filters: status
- GET /api/team-members/:id
- POST /api/team-members
- PUT /api/team-members/:id
- PUT /api/team-members/:id/status

Financial summary endpoints

Extend the dashboard with expense info:

- GET /api/dashboard/financial
  - Inputs: optional fromDate, toDate (defaults: current month)
  - Returns:
    - totalInvoiced       (sum of Invoice.totalAmount in range)
    - totalCollected      (sum of Payments.amount in range)
    - totalExpenses       (sum of Expense.amount with status=PAID in range)
    - totalSalaries       (sum of SalaryPayment.amount in range)
    - netProfit           = totalCollected - (totalExpenses + totalSalaries)
    - breakdownByCategory (array: categoryName, totalAmount)
    - topVendors          (top 5 vendors by spend)

Reuse existing dashboard summary endpoint or merge them cleanly.

------------------
3) FRONTEND – NEW SECTIONS AND SCREENS
------------------

Update sidebar to include:

------------------
4) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
------------------

- Keep validation strict on the backend (no negative amounts, required fields).
- Handle loading and error states properly on the frontend.
- Ensure existing Phase 1 functionality (clients and invoices) still works.
- Update README to describe Phase 2 features:
  - New models
  - How to create expenses, vendors, and salaries
  - Example flows for:
    - Recording a Facebook Ads bill as an expense
    - Paying a freelancer vendor
    - Recording monthly salaries and checking net profit.

Now update the existing codebase to implement all Phase 2 features described above.
